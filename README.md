# Design Patterns in Java

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

**Design Patterns** are well-proven standard solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.  
They provide a reusable approach to solving issues related to object creation, structure, and communication.

### Why Design Patterns?

Imagine you have a program that connects to a database.  
If different parts of the program create their own connections independently, it can cause:

- Wasted memory
- Conflicts between connections

To solve this, we use the **Singleton Design Pattern** (ensuring only one instance of the object exists).

Without design patterns, every developer might solve the same problem in their own way, leading to inconsistency.  
Patterns act like a **shared idea** that can be implemented in any programming language.

## ðŸ”‘ Types of Design Patterns

### 1. Creational Design Patterns

- Deal with **object creation**
- Examples: **Singleton, Factory, Builder**

### 2. Structural Design Patterns

- Deal with **object structure**
- Examples: **Adapter, Bridge, Proxy, Flyweight**

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

- Deal with **object communication**
- Examples: **Observer, Strategy, Command**
